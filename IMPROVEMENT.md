Architecture Summary
This is a robust and well-designed application. Here's a quick summary:
Frontend: A Next.js dashboard for visualizing and managing the knowledge graph.
Backend API: A comprehensive Express.js REST API that the frontend consumes.
Core Logic: The backend is built on the Qdrant vector database, which stores and queries graph data. It leverages an AI service for tasks like entity extraction.
Programmatic Interface: The application exposes its core functions as "tools" via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) over stdio. This allows other applications, like an AI assistant, to use it as a knowledge source.
Deployment: The application is container-friendly (using Docker for Qdrant) and has clear scripts for building and running in various modes (UI+API, API only, MCP only).
Potential Areas for Improvement
The architecture is solid, but like any system, there are opportunities for enhancement. I've identified a few areas, ranging from specific code changes to broader architectural considerations.
Here are my suggestions:
Monolithic Server File (mcp-server.ts)
Issue: The mcp-server.ts file is currently over 700 lines long, handling server setup, Next.js integration, all API route definitions, and MCP server configuration. This makes the file difficult to navigate and maintain as the application grows.
Suggestion: I recommend refactoring mcp-server.ts by splitting the responsibilities into smaller, more focused modules. For instance, the Express API routes could be moved to a dedicated app/api/ui/routes/ directory, with separate files for projectRoutes.ts, entityRoutes.ts, etc. This is a standard and highly effective practice in Express applications that would significantly improve maintainability.
Inefficient Relationship Handling in Qdrant
Issue: The API route for fetching related entities (.../entities/:entityId/related) currently retrieves all relationships in a project and then filters them within the application. This approach will become slow and resource-intensive as the number of relationships in your graph grows. It also fetches the full data for each related entity one by one, which can lead to performance issues (an N+1 query problem).
Suggestion: To optimize this, you could improve the data model for relationships in Qdrant. While Qdrant isn't a native graph database, you could, for example, store direct relationship information within an entity's payload. Additionally, fetching all related entities in a single batch query, rather than individually in a loop, would provide a significant performance boost.
Configuration Management
Issue: Configuration values like port numbers and service URLs appear to be managed directly through environment variables within the code.
Suggestion: Centralizing these settings into a dedicated configuration module would make your application easier to manage and deploy across different environments (development, staging, production).
API Input Validation
Issue: While there are some basic checks, the API doesn't rigorously validate the structure of incoming data.
Suggestion: You're already using zod, an excellent validation library. I recommend using it to define schemas for all your API request bodies. This would make your API more robust, secure, and provide clearer error feedback to clients.
