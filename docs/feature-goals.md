Here’s a clear breakdown of your MCP server’s goals, features, the issues it’s tackling, and how it will resolve them:


### **Goal of Your MCP Server**
The goal of your MCP server is to create a lightweight, fast system that empowers AI agents to maintain and utilize a persistent, evolving knowledge graph for coding projects. This allows the AI to retain context across different chat sessions—whether in tools like Cursor IDE or cloud-based applications—without requiring you to repeatedly provide the same information. Ultimately, it aims to streamline AI-assisted coding, making it more efficient, scalable, and seamlessly integrated into your development workflow.



### **Key Features**
Your MCP server will include the following features:

1. **Knowledge Graph Storage**  
   - Powered by KuzuDB (a lightweight, embeddable graph database) to store entities, relationships, observations, and confidence scores about your codebase.

2. **API Endpoints**  
   - **Fetch Context**: Retrieve context (observations and confidence scores) for a specific feature or entity.
   Fetch Context: This high-level goal is achieved through a combination of:
        get_entity: Retrieves details and observations for a specific known entity.
        list_entities: Discovers entities, possibly filtered by type or name.
        get_related_entities: Finds entities connected to a specific entity (e.g., functions called by this one).
        get_relationships: Gets details about the connections themselves (e.g., find all 'calls' relationships).
        Analysis: Breaking "Fetch Context" down like this gives the AI agent much more precision. Instead of a vague request, it can ask for exactly the type of context it needs (details of one thing, a list, or connections), which is likely more efficient and useful for specific coding tasks.  
   - **Update Graph**: Add new observations as the codebase evolves.  
        Update Graph: This high-level goal maps to:
        create_entity: Adds a new node (file, function, concept).
        create_relationship: Adds a new edge (connection between entities).
        add_observation: Adds specific textual details to an existing entity.
        update_entity_description: Modifies the core description of an entity.
        Analysis: Again, granularity is key. A single "Update Graph" command would be very complex to define. Does the AI want to add an entity, a relationship, or just an observation? Separating these allows for simpler, more focused API calls and reduces ambiguity. It enables the AI to make precise additions or modifications as it learns about the codebase.
   - **Invalidate Observations**: Mark or remove outdated observations after changes.  
    delete_observation: Removes a specific piece of textual information.
        delete_relationship: Removes a connection.
        delete_entity: Removes a node and its associated connections/observations.
        Analysis: This allows for targeted removal. The AI can decide whether to remove just a single incorrect observation, a defunct relationship, or an entire entity that no longer exists. delete_observation directly addresses the goal, while the others handle broader invalidation scenarios.
        - **(Optional) Version Query**: Filter or query observations by version (e.g., commit ID or timestamp).

3. **Guidelines for AI**  
   - Embedded in each endpoint via JSON specifications (defining input/output formats and constraints), ensuring the AI sends valid and appropriate requests.

4. **UI for Manual Intervention**  
   - A lightweight frontend (e.g., built with Next.js) running on a specific port (e.g., 8080) to visualize the knowledge graph.  
   - Enables you to manually delete or invalidate observations if they’re incorrect or no longer relevant, giving you direct control over the AI’s context.

5. **Version Tracking**  
   - Tags observations with version information (e.g., commit IDs or timestamps) to keep the knowledge graph aligned with the current state of your codebase.

6. **Confidence Scores**  
   - Assigns a confidence score to each observation, indicating its reliability, which helps the AI prioritize or question data as needed.

### **Issues It’s Trying to Resolve**
Your MCP server addresses the following challenges in AI-assisted coding:

1. **Context Loss Between Sessions**  
   - AI agents lose track of the codebase’s context between chat sessions, forcing you to re-explain your project repeatedly.

2. **Scalability with Large Codebases**  
   - As codebases grow, AI agents struggle to manage the increased complexity, resulting in less accurate or relevant responses.

3. **Manual Overhead**  
   - You spend unnecessary time providing context or correcting AI misunderstandings, which slows down your workflow.

4. **Lack of Persistent Memory**  
   - Existing solutions lack a persistent, structured memory of the codebase’s structure, features, or domain-specific knowledge.

---

### **How It Will Resolve These Issues**
Your MCP server tackles these problems with the following solutions:

1. **Persistent Knowledge Graph**  
   - Stores the codebase’s structure, features, and observations in KuzuDB, enabling the AI to access and build on this context across sessions, eliminating the need for you to repeat yourself.

2. **Efficient Context Retrieval**  
   - Allows the AI to fetch specific context for features or entities on demand, enabling it to handle large codebases by focusing only on relevant parts rather than processing everything at once.

3. **Automated Updates and Invalidation**  
   - As your codebase changes, the AI can update the knowledge graph with new observations and invalidate outdated ones, keeping the context current without requiring manual effort.

4. **Manual Control via UI**  
   - Provides a UI for you to directly interact with the knowledge graph, letting you delete or invalidate incorrect observations to quickly align the AI’s understanding with your needs.

5. **Confidence Scores**  
   - Attaches a confidence score to each observation, allowing the AI to assess the reliability of its information, improving response accuracy and flagging uncertainties for review.

6. **Version Tracking**  
   - Tags observations with version information to ensure the AI’s context matches the exact state of your codebase, preventing confusion from outdated or irrelevant data.

### **Summary**
Your MCP server is designed to make AI-assisted coding smarter and more efficient by providing a persistent, scalable, and manageable knowledge graph. It eliminates the frustration of context loss, reduces manual overhead, and keeps the AI aligned with your project’s evolution. With features like confidence scores, version tracking, and a user-friendly UI, it automates context management while giving you the control to fine-tune the AI’s understanding when necessary. This setup will save you time, boost productivity, and make AI a more reliable partner in your development process.
