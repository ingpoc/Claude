# MCP Server: Feature Goals

Here’s a clear breakdown of your MCP server’s goals, features, the issues it’s tackling, and how it will resolve them:

### **Goal of Your MCP Server**

The primary goal of this MCP server is to create a lightweight, fast, and persistent knowledge graph system that empowers AI clients (like Claude) to maintain and utilize context about coding projects or other domains across different sessions and interactions. It allows the AI to retain understanding without requiring users to repeatedly provide the same information, aiming to streamline AI assistance, make it more efficient, scalable, and seamlessly integrated into development workflows.

### **Key Features**

Your MCP server will include the following core features:

1.  **Persistent Knowledge Graph Storage**:
    *   Utilizes **KuzuDB**, a lightweight, embeddable graph database, to persistently store entities (like files, functions, concepts), relationships between them (e.g., 'calls', 'imports', 'contains'), and textual observations associated with entities. This data survives server restarts.
2.  **MCP Tool Interface**:
    *   Provides a suite of tools accessible via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for managing the knowledge graph. These tools allow AI clients to:
        *   **Create & Manage Entities**: Add new nodes (files, functions, classes, concepts) to the graph (`create_entity`, `update_entity_description`, `delete_entity`).
        *   **Define & Manage Relationships**: Create links between entities to represent connections (`create_relationship`, `delete_relationship`).
        *   **Add Contextual Observations**: Attach specific textual details or notes to entities (`add_observation`, `delete_observation`).
        *   **Query the Graph**: Retrieve specific entities (`get_entity`), list entities based on criteria (`list_entities`), find connected entities (`get_related_entities`), and examine relationships (`get_relationships`).
3.  **Clear Tool Definitions**:
    *   Each tool has a well-defined input/output schema (using JSON Schema or similar, specified via the MCP SDK) guiding the AI client on how to use it correctly.
4.  **(Optional) Version Tracking & Confidence Scores**:
    *   Future enhancements could include tagging observations with version information (e.g., commit IDs) and assigning confidence scores to indicate reliability, helping the AI manage evolving and uncertain information.
5.  **(Optional) UI for Manual Interaction**:
    *   A potential lightweight frontend (e.g., built with Next.js, running separately) could be developed to visualize the graph and allow users to manually inspect, add, or remove information, providing direct oversight.

### **Issues It’s Trying to Resolve**

This MCP server addresses the following challenges in AI-assisted tasks:

1.  **Context Loss Between Sessions**: AI agents often lose track of project details or conversation history between interactions, forcing users to re-explain.
2.  **Scalability with Complex Information**: Managing and reasoning over large amounts of information (like extensive codebases) becomes difficult for AI without structured context.
3.  **Manual Context Provisioning**: Users spend significant time providing necessary background information or correcting AI misunderstandings due to lack of context.
4.  **Lack of Persistent, Structured Memory**: Standard AI interactions lack a dedicated, persistent memory tailored to specific projects or domains.

### **How It Will Resolve These Issues**

This MCP server tackles these problems with the following solutions:

1.  **Persistent Knowledge Graph**: By storing the domain's structure, features, and observations in KuzuDB, the server provides a persistent memory accessible across sessions, eliminating repetitive explanations.
2.  **Efficient & Targeted Context Retrieval**: The query tools (`get_entity`, `get_related_entities`, etc.) allow the AI to fetch specific, relevant context on demand, enabling better handling of complex information by focusing only on necessary parts.
3.  **Structured Context Management**: The graph structure (entities, relationships, observations) provides a more organized way for the AI to store and retrieve information compared to unstructured chat history. AI clients can update the graph as they learn.
4.  **(Optional) Manual Oversight via UI**: A user interface would offer a way to directly inspect and correct the AI's stored knowledge, ensuring alignment and accuracy.
5.  **(Optional) Reliability Indicators**: Confidence scores and versioning (if implemented) would help the AI assess information reliability and relevance over time.

### **Summary**

This MCP server aims to make AI interactions smarter and more efficient by providing a persistent, structured, and queryable knowledge graph. It combats context loss, improves scalability for complex domains, and reduces the need for manual context re-provisioning. By offering specific tools for graph manipulation and querying via the standardized Model Context Protocol, it enables AI clients like Claude to build and leverage a dedicated memory for enhanced performance and consistency in tasks like coding assistance.
