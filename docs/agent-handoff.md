I can see where I encountered problems with the MCP knowledge graph server during my analysis. There were two main issues:

Creating relationships between entities: When I tried to create relationships between the entities in the knowledge graph, I received "Error: Failed to create relationship" responses. I attempted this with both detailed and simplified relationship descriptions, but neither approach worked.
Adding observations with arrays: Initially when trying to add multiple observations to an entity at once (as an array), it failed. I had to add observations one at a time instead.

These issues might be related to:

Potential bugs in the relationship creation functionality in the KuzuDB implementation
Possible transaction handling issues in the knowledge graph operations
Configuration problems with the server setup

Looking at the code in knowledgeGraph.ts, I noticed there's extensive error handling and retry logic around entity creation and verification, which suggests the developers were aware of reliability issues with some operations.
Would you like me to investigate any particular aspect of these problems in more detail, or would you prefer to look at other aspects of the MCP knowledge graph server implementation?
