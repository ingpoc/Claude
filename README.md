# AI Memory System (MCP) Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines how to implement a Knowledge Graph MCP (Memory Context Protocol) to help AI agents retain and utilize project context across chat sessions. The system is designed to be comprehensive enough to provide valuable context while remaining simple enough for AI to maintain.

## Core Data Structure

### Entity Model

Entities represent discrete elements of your codebase or project knowledge.

```typescript
interface Entity {
  id: string;                // Unique identifier
  name: string;              // Human-readable name
  type: string;              // Entity type (component, function, domain, etc.)
  description: string;       // Brief purpose explanation
  observations: string[];    // Detailed knowledge/context
  parentId?: string;         // Optional parent for hierarchical organization
}
```

### Relationship Model

Relationships define how entities connect to one another.

```typescript
interface Relationship {
  from: string;              // Source entity ID
  to: string;                // Target entity ID
  type: string;              // Relationship type (depends_on, composed_of, etc.)
}
```

## Entity Types

Define a clear set of entity types that cover your project's structure:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `domain` | High-level functional area | Authentication, Data Processing |
| `component` | UI component | Navbar, Button, Modal |
| `page` | Application page | HomePage, UserProfile |
| `function` | Reusable function | formatDate(), validateInput() |
| `class` | Class definition | UserService, DataProcessor |
| `api` | API endpoint | GET /users, POST /auth/login |
| `utility` | Helper/utility | Logger, ErrorHandler |
| `config` | Configuration | webpack.config.js, .env |

## Relationship Types

Keep relationship types simple but meaningful:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `depends_on` | Entity A requires Entity B | UserProfile depends_on AuthService |
| `composed_of` | Entity A contains Entity B | Dashboard composed_of UserStats |
| `calls` | Entity A calls/invokes Entity B | LoginForm calls validateCredentials |
| `extends` | Entity A extends/inherits Entity B | AdminUser extends User |
| `related_to` | General association | UserSettings related_to UserProfile |

## Observation Guidelines

Observations are where detailed knowledge lives. Each observation should be:

1. **Focused** - Address one specific aspect of the entity
2. **Actionable** - Provide information useful for development
3. **Clear** - Written in plain language
4. **Complete** - Include enough context to stand alone

### Example Observation Types:

- **Purpose**: "This component handles user input validation before form submission"
- **Implementation**: "Uses React.useEffect to fetch data when the component mounts"
- **Dependencies**: "Requires the UserContext to access current user information"
- **Patterns**: "Follows the observer pattern to notify parent components of changes"
- **Gotchas**: "The API call will fail if the user ID isn't included in the request"
- **Requirements**: "Must validate email format and ensure password meets complexity requirements"

## API Design

### Create Entity
```http
POST /api/entities
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "UserAuthentication",
  "type": "domain",
  "description": "Handles user authentication flows",
  "observations": [
    "Uses JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies",
    "Implements password reset via email verification"
  ]
}
```

### Add Observation
```http
POST /api/entities/{entityId}/observations
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "observation": "The login form uses client-side validation with Zod schema"
}
```

### Create Relationship
```http
POST /api/relationships
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "from": "login-form",
  "to": "authentication-service",
  "type": "depends_on"
}
```

### Query Context
```http
GET /api/context?entity=login-form&depth=2
```

## Example: UI Component Entity

```json
{
  "id": "login-form",
  "name": "LoginForm",
  "type": "component",
  "description": "User login form with validation and error handling",
  "observations": [
    "Located at src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx",
    "Accepts email and password inputs with client-side validation",
    "Uses the useFormik hook from Formik for form state management",
    "Displays field-specific error messages below each input",
    "Handles API errors through a try/catch block on form submission",
    "Stores the JWT token in an HTTP-only cookie via the 'login' API endpoint",
    "Displays a loading spinner during API requests",
    "Redirects to the dashboard on successful login via useNavigate hook",
    "When modifying validation logic, also update the corresponding backend validation in AuthController"
  ]
}
```

## Example: Entity Relationships

```json
[
  {
    "from": "login-form",
    "to": "auth-service",
    "type": "depends_on"
  },
  {
    "from": "login-form",
    "to": "input-component",
    "type": "composed_of"
  },
  {
    "from": "login-form",
    "to": "validation-utils",
    "type": "calls"
  },
  {
    "from": "auth-page",
    "to": "login-form",
    "type": "composed_of"
  }
]
```

## Implementation Approach

1. **Start with Core Entities**
   - Identify the main components, pages, and services of your application
   - Create entries with basic descriptions

2. **Add Detailed Observations**
   - For each entity, add detailed observations about functionality, requirements, etc.
   - Include code snippets where helpful

3. **Define Relationships**
   - Map how entities relate to one another
   - Focus on the most important dependencies first

4. **Iterate and Refine**
   - As the AI uses the system, encourage it to update and improve entries
   - Periodically review for accuracy and completeness

## AI Update Patterns

Encourage the AI to follow these patterns when updating the graph:

### Creating a New Entity
```
I'll create a new entity for this component:
- Name: UserProfileForm
- Type: component
- Description: Form for editing user profile information
- Observations:
  1. Located at src/components/profile/UserProfileForm.tsx
  2. Uses React Hook Form for form state management
  3. Includes field validation for name, email, and bio
```

### Adding an Observation
```
I'll add an observation to the UserProfileForm entity:
"The form includes image upload functionality using the FileUploader component"
```

### Creating a Relationship
```
I'll create a relationship:
- From: UserProfileForm
- To: FileUploader
- Type: composed_of
```

## Integration with AI Workflows

For maximum benefit, integrate the MCP into your AI workflows:

1. **Context Retrieval**
   - Before starting a task, AI queries the MCP for relevant context
   - Example: "Retrieve all entities related to user authentication"

2. **Context Updates**
   - After completing a task, AI updates the MCP with new knowledge
   - Example: "Add observation that LoginForm now supports SSO"

3. **Knowledge Navigation**
   - AI can traverse relationships to understand dependencies
   - Example: "What components depend on AuthService?"

## Conclusion

By implementing this Knowledge Graph MCP, your AI assistants will maintain a persistent understanding of your project's structure, components, and requirements. This will significantly reduce repetitive prompting, redundant code creation, and misunderstandings about project context.

The focus on rich, detailed observations within a simple structure makes this approach both powerful and maintainable, even by AI agents themselves.
