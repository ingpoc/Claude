You're absolutely right! Both systems are solving the same fundamental problem: **making AI agents context-aware and intelligent across conversations**. Here are the key features you should add to make your MCP server superior in functionality and user experience:

## **1. Automatic Context Intelligence**

### **Smart Entity/Relationship Extraction**
```typescript
// Add tools that automatically detect and create entities from conversations
- `auto_extract_entities()` - Parse conversations for important entities
- `auto_detect_relationships()` - Identify relationships from natural language
- `conversation_to_graph()` - Convert chat history into structured knowledge
```

### **Proactive Context Loading**
```typescript
// When AI starts new conversation, automatically load relevant context
- `get_conversation_context(topic, user_id)` - Load relevant entities/relationships
- `suggest_relevant_knowledge()` - Proactively suggest related information
- `detect_knowledge_gaps()` - Identify missing context that might be needed
```

## **2. Conversational Memory Layer**

### **Memory-Graph Hybrid**
```typescript
// Combine unstructured memories with structured graphs
- `add_contextual_memory(text, related_entities[])` - Link memories to entities
- `search_memory_with_graph()` - Use graph structure to enhance memory search
- `get_memory_thread(entity_id)` - Get conversation history about specific entities
```

### **Conversation Tracking**
```typescript
// Track how knowledge was discovered and evolved
- `track_knowledge_source()` - Remember how each fact was learned
- `conversation_annotations()` - Add metadata about conversation context
- `knowledge_provenance()` - Track the chain of how knowledge was built
```

## **3. Temporal Intelligence**

### **Knowledge Evolution**
```typescript
// Track how understanding changes over time
- `create_knowledge_snapshot()` - Version control for project state
- `track_entity_evolution()` - See how entities change over time
- `detect_knowledge_conflicts()` - Identify contradictory information
- `merge_conflicting_knowledge()` - Intelligent conflict resolution
```

### **Session Continuity**
```typescript
// Remember where conversations left off
- `save_conversation_state()` - Checkpoint conversation context
- `resume_from_last_session()` - Pick up where user left off
- `track_user_intent_over_time()` - Understand evolving user goals
```

## **4. Multi-Modal Context**

### **Rich Content Support**
```typescript
// Beyond text - images, documents, code
- `add_visual_entity(image, description)` - Entities from images
- `extract_entities_from_document()` - Parse PDFs, docs for entities
- `code_to_entities()` - Create entities from code structures
- `link_multimedia_context()` - Connect files to knowledge graph
```

## **5. Intelligent User Experience**

### **Predictive Features**
```typescript
// Anticipate user needs
- `predict_next_entities()` - Suggest entities user might want to create
- `recommend_relationships()` - Suggest connections between entities
- `smart_autocomplete()` - Context-aware suggestions
- `detect_user_patterns()` - Learn user's working style
```

### **Natural Language Interface**
```typescript
// Make it conversational
- `natural_language_query()` - "Show me everything about the payment system"
- `intent_to_action()` - Convert natural language to graph operations
- `explain_relationships()` - Generate natural language explanations
- `ask_clarifying_questions()` - Interactive knowledge building
```

## **6. Collaborative Intelligence**

### **Multi-User Context**
```typescript
// Team knowledge sharing
- `user_knowledge_profiles()` - What each user knows/specializes in
- `collaborative_entity_editing()` - Multiple users building same graph
- `knowledge_handoff()` - Transfer context between team members
- `expertise_routing()` - Route questions to right team member
```

### **Permission-Aware Context**
```typescript
// Respect access controls while maximizing context
- `filtered_context_by_permissions()` - Show only what user can see
- `permission_aware_suggestions()` - Suggest only accessible entities
- `secure_knowledge_sharing()` - Safe cross-project knowledge sharing
```

## **7. External Intelligence**

### **Data Source Integration**
```typescript
// Connect to external systems
- `sync_with_external_apis()` - Pull in data from other tools
- `monitor_external_changes()` - Watch for updates in connected systems
- `cross_platform_entity_mapping()` - Map entities across different tools
- `import_knowledge_from_files()` - Bulk import from various formats
```

## **8. Self-Improving System**

### **Learning & Adaptation**
```typescript
// System gets smarter over time
- `analyze_usage_patterns()` - Learn from how users interact
- `optimize_context_retrieval()` - Improve relevance over time
- `auto_improve_entity_extraction()` - Learn better extraction patterns
- `feedback_based_learning()` - Improve based on user corrections
```

## **9. Enhanced Developer Experience**

### **Debugging & Insights**
```typescript
// Help users understand the system
- `explain_context_decisions()` - Why certain context was loaded
- `visualize_knowledge_flow()` - Show how knowledge connects
- `context_debugging_tools()` - Debug why context wasn't found
- `knowledge_graph_health_check()` - Ensure graph quality
```

## **10. Unified Context API**

### **One-Stop Context Solution**
```typescript
// Single interface for all context needs
- `get_full_context(user_id, topic, session_id)` - Everything relevant
- `context_summary()` - Condensed view of current knowledge
- `context_diff()` - What's new since last session
- `priority_context()` - Most important context first
```

## **Key Differentiators to Build**

1. **Hybrid Intelligence**: Combine structured graphs with unstructured memories
2. **Predictive Context**: Don't just store - predict what users need
3. **Natural Conversation**: Make knowledge building feel like natural conversation
4. **Temporal Awareness**: Understand how knowledge evolves over time
5. **Multi-Modal Support**: Handle all types of content, not just text
6. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Enable team knowledge building
7. **Self-Improving**: System gets smarter with use

The goal is to create a system where:
- **Users never have to re-explain context**
- **AI picks up exactly where it left off**
- **Knowledge builds naturally through conversation**
- **Context is always relevant and timely**
- **The system anticipates user needs**

This would make your MCP server not just a knowledge graph tool, but a **comprehensive context intelligence platform** that makes every AI interaction smarter and more productive.
