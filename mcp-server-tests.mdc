# MCP Server Test: New Chat Session Initialization (Path or Explicit ID)

This rule outlines the steps to test how the MCP standalone server handles the initialization sequence, using either an explicitly provided identifier or the current workspace path.

**Note:** For the Claude MCP workspace (`/Users/gurusharan/Documents/Cline/MCP/Claude`), the explicitly associated project ID `project_df28cfb3-f13d-46ec-a547-75a8a0ea2fd2` (named "Claude MCP Knowledge Graph") can be used if preferred over the path-based identifier.

## Preconditions

1.  **MCP Server Running:** The `standalone-server.js` must be running.
2.  **Cursor Connection Refreshed:** The user must have refreshed the MCP connection in Cursor *after* the server was started/rebuilt.
3.  **MCP Tools Available:** `mcp_knowledge_graph_init_session` and `mcp_knowledge_graph_list_projects` must be available.
4.  **Workspace Path Known:** The assistant needs to know the path to the current workspace (e.g., `/Users/gurusharan/Documents/Cline/MCP/Claude`).

## Test Steps

1.  **Determine Identifier:**
    *   Check if the user's request initiating this test explicitly provided a project identifier (name or ID, e.g., `project_df28cfb3-f13d-46ec-a547-75a8a0ea2fd2`).
    *   **If an identifier was provided:** Use that specific identifier as the `codebaseIdentifier`.
    *   **If no identifier was provided:** Use the **current workspace path** as the `codebaseIdentifier`.

2.  **Simulate Initialization (`init_session`)**:
    *   Call the `mcp_knowledge_graph_init_session` tool.
    *   Provide the `codebaseIdentifier` determined in Step 1 as the argument.

3.  **Verify Basic Functionality (`list_projects`)**:
    *   Call the `mcp_knowledge_graph_list_projects` tool.

## Verification

1.  **Successful Tool Calls:** Both `mcp_knowledge_graph_init_session` and `mcp_knowledge_graph_list_projects` tool calls must complete successfully.
2.  **No JSON Errors:** No JSON parsing errors in tool responses or MCP logs.
3.  **`init_session` Response:** The response should indicate success (e.g., "Project found...", "New project created...") and reference the **correct identifier** that was used in the call (either the explicit one or the path). It should also include the relevant `projectId`.
4.  **`list_projects` Response:** The response should contain a valid list of projects.
5.  **(Optional) Server Logs:** Check server logs (stderr) for expected messages confirming the identifier used and successful session setup.
